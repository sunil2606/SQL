### SQL COMPARISON OPERATORS 
Here we will explore all of the Comparison Operators used in SQL to test for Equality and In Equality, as well as more Advanced Operators.

**DESCRIPTION**
Comparison Operators are used in the WHERE Clause to determine which records to select. Here is a List of the Comparison Operators that you can use in SQL:
```

- =                       Equal
- <>, !=              Not Equal
- >                      Greater than
- >=                    Greater than or Equal
- <                       Less than
- <=                    Less than or Equal
- IN( )                  Matches a Value in a list
- NOT                  Negates a Condition
- BETWEEN          Within a range (inclusive)
- IS NULL             NULL value
- LIKE                   Pattern matching with % and _
- EXISTS               Condition is met if subquery returns at least one row
```

**NOTE:** In SQL, there are two ways to test for inequality in a query. You can use either the '<>' or '!=' operator. Both will return the same results.
